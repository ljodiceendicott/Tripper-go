# Tripper Go

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).


## What is this?
This is an interative project that is built in React native, that will allow for users to plan a trip and have a visual representation of where each song will be played.

This is built w/ React Native and uses the Google Maps Api as well as the Spotify API to get the tools that are needed


### Current status
#### API connections
[ ] - Google Maps API
   [ ] - Connect to Google API 
   [ ] - Current location
   [ ] - trip planner API
   [ ] - Get data for how long the trip will be
   [ ] - Guesstimate how many songs
   [ ] - gather user inputs
   [ ] - highlight trip with lines
   [ ] - seperate each section of trip based on songs (need this returned by Spotify API)
   
[ ] - Connect to Spotify API
   [X] - Get sample data
   [ ] - show this data on page
   [ ] - Get user's playlists
   [ ] - Get songs on selected playlists

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
